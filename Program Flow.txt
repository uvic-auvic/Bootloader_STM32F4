Boodloader program flow

1) Check if bootloader is restarting after programming. Data in the config section will tell this.
2) Check for data on UART
	If yes: Start receiving data and programing flash
	Else: continue
3) Do checksum on Application sector.
	If checksum is okay: Continue to application
	Else: Throw Error

	
To continue to application:
	Write to the correct location in the config section to tell the bootloaded to imediately load the application on reset
